# Diffusion Model for Chinese Calligraphy

#### Motivation
Calligraphy is a significant form of art and culture. In this project, I aim to diversify calligraphic expressions through AI generation, expanding the realm of calligraphic art!

#### Tools and Data
* Diffusion model training structure
* UNET and CS attention
* ~1000 calligraphy figures

#### Module
* Pytorch
* Opencv

#### Result
> The generated pictures:

<img src="./figure/dragon.gif" width="20%" height="20%"/>

#### Brief summary
In this project, I train the diffusion model from scratch, and figure out its amazing creation ability!
This stuff can be effectively used in developing new calligraphy styles.
